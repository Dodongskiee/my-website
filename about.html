            <h4>WHAT IS REPUBLIC ACT 10630 ALL ABOUT?</h4>
            <p>Raises the minimum age of criminal responsibility from 9 years old to 15 years old. This means that children under 15 cannot be prosecuted for criminal offenses and are exempt from criminal liability.
                Establishes a system of intervention programs for children in conflict with the law (CICLs). These programs are designed to provide CICLs with counseling, education, and other support services to help them rehabilitate and reintegrate into society.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ABOUT-col">

            <p>Creates different procedures for dealing with CICLs aged 15-18, depending on their level of discernment. If a child aged 15-18 is found to have acted with discernment, they may be subjected to the appropriate criminal proceedings; however, the Act emphasizes rehabilitation and restorative justice even for these cases.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ABOUT-col">
            
            <p>Promotes family involvement in the rehabilitation of CICLs. The Act recognizes the importance of family in a child's life and encourages parents and guardians to participate in intervention programs and court proceedings.
                Establishes various support institutions and mechanisms for implementing the Act. These include Intensive Juvenile Intervention and Support Centers (IJISCs), Bahay Pag-asa facilities for temporary shelter, and multi-disciplinary teams to assess and support CICLs.</p>
